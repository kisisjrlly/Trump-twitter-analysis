Mar 2, 2018 05:50:34 AM When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don’t trade anymore-we win big. It’s easy! [Twitter for iPhone]  link

Feb 22, 2018 08:05:18 AM ....If a potential “sicko shooter” knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school.

Feb 22, 2018 07:54:09 AM ....History shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes. It takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime.

Feb 22, 2018 07:40:08 AM ....immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this.

Feb 22, 2018 07:26:28 AM I never said “give teachers guns” like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @NBC.

Feb 20, 2018 07:54:39 AM Republicans are now leading the Generic Poll, perhaps because of the popular Tax Cuts which the Dems want to take away. Actually, they want to raise you taxes, substantially. Also, they want to do nothing on DACA, R’s want to fix! [Twitter for iPhone]  link
Feb 20, 2018 07:46:18 AM ....The President Obama quote just before election.

Feb 18, 2018 07:43:48 AM Now that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election, he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats, lead by their fearless leader, Crooked Hillary Clinton, lost the 2016 election. But wasn’t I a great candidate? [Twitter for iPhone]  link
Feb 18, 2018 07:33:16 AM I never said Russia did not meddle in the election, I said “it may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.” The Russian “hoax” was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did!

Feb 18, 2018 07:22:29 AM Finally, Liddle’ Adam Schiff, the leakin’ monster of no control, is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election.

Feb 17, 2018 11:22:48 PM General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems.

Feb 17, 2018 11:08:45 PM Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud! [Twitter for iPhone]  link
Feb 17, 2018 06:45:28 PM Just like they don’t want to solve the DACA problem, why didn’t the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House & Senate during the Obama Administration. Because they didn’t want to, and now they just talk! [Twitter for iPhone]  link

Feb 16, 2018 03:18:11 PM Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President. The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion! [Twitter for iPhone]  link

Feb 15, 2018 09:57:21 AM While the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working hard to come up with a solution to DACA, they should be strongly considering a system of Merit Based Immigration so that we will have the people ready, willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the USA!

Feb 15, 2018 07:12:41 AM So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again! [Twitter for iPhone]  link

Feb 10, 2018 06:34:08 PM My Administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe, modern and lawful immigration system: fully securing the border, ending chain migration, and canceling the visa lottery.

Feb 10, 2018 01:50:02 PM Republicans want to fix DACA far more than the Democrats do. The Dems had all three branches of government back in 2008-2011, and they decided not to do anything about DACA. They only want to use it as a campaign issue. Vote Republican! [Twitter for iPhone]  link

Feb 9, 2018 08:47:28 AM Without more Republicans in Congress, we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally, after many years of depletion, take care of our Military.

Dec 24, 2017 03:35:26 PM The Tax Cut/Reform Bill, including Massive Alaska Drilling and the Repeal of the highly unpopular Individual Mandate, brought it all together as to what an incredible year we had. Don’t let the Fake News convince you otherwise...and our insider Polls are strong! [Twitter for iPhone]  link
Dec 24, 2017 08:48:11 AM The Fake News refuses to talk about how Big and how Strong our BASE is. They show Fake Polls just like they report Fake News. Despite only negative reporting, we are doing well - nobody is going to beat us. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! [Twitter for iPhone]  link

Dec 23, 2017 05:57:50 PM Remember, the Republicans are 5-0 in Congressional races this year. In Senate, I said Roy M would lose in Alabama and supported Big Luther Strange - and Roy lost.

Dec 23, 2017 05:44:45 PM The Stock Market is setting record after record and unemployment is at a 17 year low.
